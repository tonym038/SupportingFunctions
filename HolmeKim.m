function A = HolmeKim(N,m,mt,N0)
% A = HolmeKim(N,m,mt,N0) returns a Holme-Kim model scale-free clustered graph
% with N nodes, m edges added at each time step, average mt edges added 
% via triad-formation steps during a time step, and N0 initial vertices.

% A is adjacency matrix

% Based on Petter Holme, Beom Jun Kim (2001), Growing scale-free networks 
% with tunable clustering. Physical Review E, Volume 65, 026107

% mt = 0 yields the Barabási–Albert model scale-free graph.
